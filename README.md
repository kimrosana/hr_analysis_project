# HR Data Analytics Project

During my enrollment in the Google Data Analystics Professional Certificate course, I came across several data analysis projects aimed at broadening my understanding of the profession's scope. Among these projects was one focused on a case study by Google's HR department, elucidating the concept of HR analytics and its influence on employees' experiences in the workplace, including its symbiotic relationship with corporate culture. I found this particular project captivating, as I am deeply motivated by the prospect of contributing to the enhancement of individuals' professional lives in a way that is aggregating to the company.
With that being, I stumbled upon a dataset sourced from a fictitious company and delved into this HR mock project. Here, I intend to address the following topics:

1) Create a quick HR dashboard
2) How many people are in each job?
3) How is gender equality in the company overall and inside each department/job title?
4) Age spread of the staff
5) Which jobs pay more? Which pay less?
6) Who are the top and bottom earners in the company?
7) Qualification vs. salary
	7.a) Date of join vs. salary [does the time working for the company reflect on their salary?]
	7.b) Qualification vs. gender - vs. date of join; vs. salary [what is the correlation between qualification and gender when comparing to the amount of time an employee stays in the company and when comparing the salary?]
8) Staff growth trend over time
9) Employee filter by starting letter
10) Leave balance analysis
10) Quick HR dashboard

  *DATASET LIMITATIONS*

1. There are instances where some employees appear twice in the dataset, such as Dev Joshi in the 'top earners' sheet, with two distinct employee numbers. It would be prudent to make sure whether updating his employee ID to ensure consistency across rows is necessary, despite variations in joining dates, as this could significantly affect the final analysis. Additionally, this prompts the question: does the dataset exclusively comprise information of current employees? Upon detecting duplicate names, which occur 19 times, it's apparent that 19 individuals feature more than once in the table, likely with differing joining dates, ages, or salary details. It's advisable to consult the HR department to clarify this matter.
2. A 'date of exit' column should be incorporated into the dataset. This will enable us to determine the current number of employees actively working for the company. Consequently, we would be equipped to analyze staff turnover rates and calculate the average duration of employment, both of which are pivotal metrics for gaining insights into the company's culture and organizational dynamics.
